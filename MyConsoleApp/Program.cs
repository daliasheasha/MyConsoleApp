XPLANATION START]
To migrate this app from .NET 6 to .NET 8, you will need to make the following changes:

1. Update the namespace declaration: The namespace declaration should be updated from "WebRequestSample" to reflect the new project name or organization structure.

2. Update the using statements: The using statement for "System.Net" is already included, so no changes are needed in this case.

3. Update the HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse classes: In .NET 8, the HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse classes have been deprecated. Instead, you should use the new HttpClient class, which provides a more modern and efficient way of making HTTP requests.

4. Update the stream handling: In the current code, the response stream is read using a StreamReader. In .NET 8, you can use the new ReadAsStringAsync method of the HttpResponseMessage class to simplify reading the response body.
